This repo is the code from the first website that I built all by myself. Prior to this, I had a Blogger site that I had customized a little bit, but it clearly wasn't cutting it for representing myself as a professional designer and developer.

I learned HTML and CSS from reading Jennifer Robbin's book "Learning Web Design", looked at a bunch of other designer's websites for inspiration, designed the layout in Photoshop, and then sliced it up and assembled it with HTML and CSS written in [Notepad++]( https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) (IIRC), and hosted it on Bluehost.

Eventually, I learned how to work with Wordpress and how to create a customer Wordpress theme (thanks to NetTuts+), and I added a blog on the site's /blog subdirectory (which currently doesn't work because I don't want to deal with MAMP just to share this for posterity).

There's a lot of things that are silly about this site (including my immature sense of design showcased by a logo that was the central point of focus, and other regretable design decisions), but it was my first website that I felt a real sense of ownership over for the entire site design and code, and I am still kinda proud of it.

I still recall the feeling I had when I figured out how to create the hover effect for the top nav bar items by swapping out the background image to a different image on hover, and how it felt to create my first user interaction with code. And when I figured out how to add the featured content slider with a jQuery plugin, it was like a whole new world of computer magic was opening up to me - a feeling that has inspired me to learn new technologies via tinkering on my personal site time and time again.
